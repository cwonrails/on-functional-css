            Theodore Sturgeon was a science fiction author, critic, and the basis for Kurt Vonnegut's recurring
            character Kilgore Trout. He was prolific, authoring over 200 pieces himself and critiquing around 400
            others.

            In 1958 he published a piece in Venture proclaiming what he called "Sturgeon's Revelation"

            I repeat Sturgeon's Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science
            fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose
            conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud. Using the same standards that categorize 90% of science
            fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods, etc. is
            crap. In other words, the claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative,
            because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other art forms.

            You don't have to bounce a tennis ball very far in San Francisco before it will hit two developers
            complaining about how many js tools/frameworks there are for development in 2015 and how much unnecessary
            complexity they add. Doing a search on twitter for 'too many js tools' or 'yet another js framework'
            returns... a lot of people lamenting the current state of affairs.

            This is most likely, the wrong conversation for us as a community, to be having. The presence of bad tools -
            shouldn't discourage us from wanting more tools or frameworks. There are more books published in a single
            day than I will ever be able to read in my lifetime. But this does not make me sad. Or overwhelm me. Mostly
            I think about how excited I am to read the best books that are being published. And this is where we should
            push the conversation. How do we build better tools? What does that look like?

            TYPOGRAPHY, even when poorly executed, can never be taken for granted; nor is it ever accidental. Indeed,
            beautifully typeset pages are always the result of long experience. Now and then they even attain the rank
            of great artistic achievement. But the art of typesetting stands apart from expressive artwork, because
            the appeal is not limited to a small circle. It is open to everyone's critical judgment, and nowhere does
            this judgment carry more weight. Typography that cannot be read by everybody is useless. Even for someone
            who constantly ponders matters of readability and legibility, it is difficult to determine whether something
            can be read with ease, but the average reader will rebel at once when the type is too small or otherwise
            irritates the eye; both are signs of a certain illegibility already.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
            All typography consists of letters. These appear either in the form of a smoothly running sentence or as an
            assembly of lines, which may even have contrasting shapes. Good typography begins, and this is no minor
            matter, with the typesetting of a single line of text in a book or a newspaper. Using exactly the same
            typeface, it is possible to create either a pleasant line, easily read, or an onerous one. Spacing, if it is
            too wide or too compressed, will spoil almost any typeface.
